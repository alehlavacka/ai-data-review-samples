# AI Data Review & Annotation Samples

This repository contains simple examples of AI-generated text evaluation and annotation.

I created this repository to show how I review and improve AI-generated content in a structured way.

## Example 1 – Weak AI Output Evaluation

**Original Text:**

"AI is very useful for businesses because it helps improve processes and makes companies more efficient."

**Identified Issues:**

- Vague language  
- Lack of specificity  
- No measurable impact  
- Generic phrasing  

**Improved Version:**

"AI helps businesses automate repetitive tasks, reduce operational costs, and improve decision-making through data analysis."

## Example 2 – Pattern Identification

**Observed Pattern in Multiple Outputs:**

- Repetitive generic introductions  
- Overuse of phrases like “in today’s world”  
- Lack of concrete examples  

**Conclusion:**

The outputs are correct but too general. They lack examples and specific details.

"AI tools can analyze customer behavior and improve marketing strategies."

**Assigned Tags:**

- Topic: Artificial Intelligence  
- Domain: Business / Marketing

**Reasoning:**
